## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
This project is a website for a personal portfolio for myself as an art student. This is to keep track of the art outputs I will produce troughout my school year as an art student.

The website has about 4 pages in total, the first one is the Home page where you will find the cover page of the website. Then next on the navigation bar located above, you will find the AboutMe page where information about me and my educational background is listed in, also including my skills that I have learned and are still currently learning. Next is the Artworks page where a gallery of my recent artworks are posted together. Lastly, the ContactMe page is where links of my social accounts as posted so people will know where to contact me.

The technology used in the project are HTML and CSS. HTML is used to create and structure content on the web with the use of websites. CSS is used to input design codes on the HTML to make it more appealing to the eyes.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```

|   └─ css
|   |   └─ style.css
|   └─ img
